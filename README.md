# Java Java Coffee

Java Java coffee is a coffee company run inside co-working spaces. They not only have their doors open to the genral public, but also cater for in house meeting rooms. 
The main purpose of this site would not only be to highlight their offerings, but also to enable people to submit meeting room catering requests over the website via email JS. 
This would streamline the service that the company offers for the meeting rooms.
I have also added in further javascript by making all items on the site able to add to cart which is a feature which although i dont have the skills to fully complete yet, with payment options etc. Is something I would be able to finish off in the near future.

## Design 
---

* Colour Scheme
  The colour scheme across the site is a main background color of #deecd5 which is a light pale green shade. #272727 which is a shade of black contrasts this nicely at the top of the page and I think the colours compliment eachother. I used #FDBE11 which is a goldy yellow for the brand name and some other small elements which contrasts the black colour and stands out well against it. #ADADAD and white were used across the menu items to make them stand out in the middle of the page. 

* Typography
I used three different fonts across the website. Zen Tokyo Zoo is used for the brand name at the top of the site and a couple of headings. Londrina outline is used on all the hero cards on the main page which i feel is a nice clear font that compliments these sections. The rest of the site and text is using Ubuntu which is a very clean font which is easy to read. 


* Imagery
  The homepage consists of 4 main images that stand out and clearly highlight the main purposes/areas of the site. 
  These images change to video at larger screen size and really stand out and make the site feel alive.

### Features to implement in the future
I have made a click and collect feature for the website although I don't know how to implement a payment feature or any backend code to receive orders that would be viable or efficient in terms of accepting them. I would like to be able to implement this properly when I have the relevant skills.
